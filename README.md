# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program project 1.

In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
